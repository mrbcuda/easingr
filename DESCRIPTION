Description: Forms queries to submit to the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank web
    site's credit easing policy tools data site.  Provides various query functions
    according to the easing data desired.  By default the download includes
    easing tool weekly time series data starting January 2007.  The functions
    return a class of type easing which contains a list of items related to the
    query and its graphical presentation.  The list includes the time series
    data as an xts object.  The package provides two lattice time series plots
    to render the data in a manner similar to the bank's own presentation.
